# Day 3 Implementation Summary: Blocking Flows

## Overview
Day 3 focused on implementing the complete blocking flow with strike logic, automatic unblocking, admin routes, and comprehensive negative tests with 403 handling.

## Features Already Implemented

### 1. Strike Logic ✓
- **Location**: `src/store/user_store.py` - `add_violation()` method
- Tracks violation count per user
- Automatically blocks users after 3 violations
- Sets `blocked_until` timestamp when blocking

### 2. Automatic Unblock Check ✓
- **Location**: `src/store/user_store.py` - `is_user_blocked()` method
- Checks if `blocked_until` timestamp has passed
- Automatically unblocks and resets violation count
- No background tasks needed - checked on each request

### 3. Admin Route ✓
- **Location**: `src/api/admin.py`
- `PUT /admin/unblock/{user_id}` endpoint
- Manually unblocks users and resets violation count
- Returns 404 if user doesn't exist

### 4. 403 Handling ✓
- **Location**: `src/api/chat.py`
- Returns proper 403 Forbidden when blocked users try to chat
- Includes structured error response with code and details

## New Additions for Day 3

### 1. Comprehensive Integration Tests
- **File**: `tests/test_integration.py` (new)
- Tests complete blocking flow from violations to auto-unblock
- Tests manual unblock via admin endpoint
- Tests repeat offenders can be blocked again
- Tests blocking persistence across requests

### 2. Enhanced Test Coverage
- **Enhanced**: `tests/test_chat_api.py`
  - Empty message handling
  - Special characters in user IDs
  - Very long messages
  - Concurrent violations simulation

- **Enhanced**: `tests/test_moderation.py`
  - Partial match detection
  - Multiple user mentions
  - Unicode character support
  - Empty message handling
  - Special characters in user IDs

- **Enhanced**: `tests/test_user_store.py`
  - Timestamp update verification
  - Unblocking never-blocked users
  - Multiple users with independent violations
  - Block duration configuration
  - Singleton pattern verification
  - Concurrent violation handling

### 3. Documentation Updates
- **Enhanced**: `README.md`
  - Complete API reference with request/response examples
  - Blocking flow explanation
  - Design decisions documentation
  - Environment variables documentation

### 4. Code Documentation
- **Enhanced**: `src/services/moderation.py`
  - Added detailed docstring for `process_message` explaining the flow

## Test Results Summary

### Unit Tests
- User Store: 16 test cases covering all edge cases
- Moderation Service: 15 test cases including unicode and special characters
- Chat API: 11 test cases including error scenarios
- Admin API: 3 test cases covering success and error paths

### Integration Tests
- 7 comprehensive integration tests covering:
  - Three-strikes blocking flow
  - Automatic unblocking after timeout
  - Manual unblocking via admin endpoint
  - Repeat offender handling
  - Non-existent user handling
  - Blocking state persistence

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No Background Tasks**: Automatic unblocking is checked on each request rather than using background tasks or cron jobs. This keeps the implementation simple and stateless.

2. **In-Memory Storage**: User data is stored in memory with a singleton pattern. While this means data is lost on restart, it keeps the service self-contained.

3. **Immediate Strike Effect**: Users can still send the message that gives them their 3rd strike - they're only blocked for subsequent messages.

4. **Reset on Unblock**: Both automatic and manual unblocking reset the violation count to 0, giving users a fresh start.

## Next Steps for Day 4
- Implement retry logic and backoff for OpenAI client
- Add request timeout handling
- Enhance error handling for network issues
- Update documentation with OpenAI integration details
- Add OpenAPI tags for better documentation
