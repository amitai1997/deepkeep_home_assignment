Of course. Here is a revised version of the assignment that explicitly requires the implementation of all features, while still emphasizing clarity and focus for the review process.

### **Home Assignment: Building a Complete Python Microservice**

Thank you for moving forward in our interview process. This technical project is designed to give you an opportunity to showcase your skills in building a complete, self-contained service from start to finish.

Our goal is to see how you write clear, logical, and maintainable code. While the features are comprehensive, we encourage you to prioritize simplicity and strong fundamentals in your implementation. Your submission should be a project that is easy for an interviewer to run, test, and understand.

### **Project Goal: An Intelligent Chat Gateway**

You are tasked with building a RESTful API server that manages user access to the OpenAI API. The project is divided into two parts: the core user-facing chat functionality and the backend administrative systems that manage user access. **All of the following features must be implemented in code.**

#### **Part 1: Core Chat Service Implementation**

This is the main user-facing component of your application.

1.  **Build an Asynchronous RESTful Server:**
    * Use a modern Python framework like **FastAPI** or **Aiohttp**.
    * Create a primary endpoint (e.g., `POST /chat/{user_id}`) that accepts a JSON request with a user's message.
    * All external API calls (to OpenAI) must be handled asynchronously.

2.  **Implement User State Management:**
    * You do not need an external database. A simple **in-memory Python dictionary** is the preferred method for storing user data for this assignment. This keeps the project self-contained.
    * Your data structure for each user should track their violation count and their blocked status.

3.  **Enforce the Business Logic:**
    * **Content Moderation:** Before forwarding a request to OpenAI, check if the message contains the `user_id` of any other user in your system.
    * **Blocking Policy:** Implement a "three-strikes" rule. When a user violates the content rule for the third time, their status must be set to "blocked."
    * **Access Control:** Blocked users must be prevented from making new requests and should receive an appropriate error response (e.g., `403 Forbidden`).

#### **Part 2: Administrative and System Features Implementation**

This part involves building the necessary backend systems to manage the user policies you created in Part 1.

1.  **Implement a Manual Unblock Endpoint:**
    * Create a new, working API endpoint (e.g., `PUT /admin/unblock/{user_id}`).
    * When this endpoint is called, it should find the specified user in your in-memory store and reset their violation count to `0` and their blocked status to `False`.

2.  **Implement an Automated Unblocking Mechanism:**
    * Enhance your system so that users are automatically unblocked after a set period of time (e.g., 24 hours).
    * **Implementation Guideline:** To keep the project simple and self-contained, we recommend the following approach:
        * When a user is blocked, store a `blocked_until` timestamp along with their user data.
        * In your main `/chat/{user_id}` endpoint logic, add a check for blocked users: if a request comes from a blocked user, first check if the current time is past their `blocked_until` timestamp. If it is, automatically unblock them and allow their request to proceed (assuming it doesn't violate any rules). If the block period has not yet expired, reject the request.
        * This approach avoids the complexity of background threads or separate processes and is ideal for this assignment.

### **Deliverables and Evaluation Criteria**

Your submission should be a complete, working application.

1.  **All Source Code:** The complete Python project, organized logically.
2.  **A `README.md` File:** This is a critical component. It should be a clear guide for the reviewer.
    * **Setup Instructions:** Provide simple, step-by-step instructions to install dependencies (`requirements.txt`) and run the server with a single command.
    * **API Guide:** Document all your endpoints (`/chat`, `/admin/unblock`). Explain how to use them, including example requests (e.g., using `curl`).
    * **Design Notes:** Briefly explain your key decisions. Why did you structure your code the way you did? How does your automated unblocking mechanism work?

#### **How We Will Evaluate Your Work:**

* **Functionality:** Does the application work as described? Do all features, including the automated unblocking, function correctly?
* **Code Quality:** Is your code clean, readable, and well-structured?
* **Problem-Solving:** Does your implementation show a clear and logical approach to solving the requirements?
* **Clarity:** How easily can a reviewer understand, run, and test your project? The `README` is key here.
