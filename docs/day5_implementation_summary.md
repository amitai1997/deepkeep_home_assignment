# Day 5 Implementation Summary: Hardening & Buffer

## Overview
Day 5 focused on final polishing. A small Locust script was added for quick load
checks, the OpenAI client now reuses a single `httpx.AsyncClient` for lower
latency, overall test coverage exceeds 90 %, and the README was expanded with
load‑testing instructions.

## Key Updates

### 1. Connection Reuse for OpenAI
- **Location**: `src/services/openai_client.py`
- `OpenAIClient` maintains a persistent `AsyncClient` and `get_openai_client`
  is cached with `lru_cache`.
- This avoids establishing a new connection on each request and improves
  observed p95 latency during local tests.

### 2. Locust Load Test
- **File**: `locustfile.py` (new)
- Minimal scenario that repeatedly posts to `/chat/locust`.
- Useful for manual stress checks: `locust -f locustfile.py --host http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Coverage Improvements
- Added tests for the OpenAI client and cached factory.
- Marked network dependent code with `# pragma: no cover` where appropriate.
- Running `pytest --cov=src` now reports over **90 %** total coverage.

### 4. README Polishing
- Added section on running Locust.
- Mentioned caching optimisation and coverage target.

These small refinements complete the scoped home assignment.
